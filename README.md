# Rainy Day â€“ GSAP Keyframe Animation

This is a personal web animation project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the GSAP library.
A rainy night scene is animated with floating lights, a walking woman, and a cat by the window. 
The motion is created using keyframe sequences and random animation patterns with GSAP.

## Overview

This project explores layered animation with both static and animated visual elements.  
- Background and window images are used to create depth.  
- Lights appear and flicker in randomized positions.  
- A character walks continuously from left to right using a GIF.  
- The entire scene is looped using GSAP's animation engine.

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS (with `position: absolute`, blur effects, box shadows)  
- JavaScript (for DOM creation and animation)  
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

## Features

- 30 randomly positioned lights with dynamic opacity and color  
- Smooth keyframe animation for character movement  
- Layered z-index structure with blur overlay and background  
- Responsive layout with consistent frame size (800x400)

## Notes

- This project was built as a study in motion design using GSAP.  
- The visual layout is not fully responsive but focuses on animation behavior within a fixed-size frame.  
- Character and background visuals are animated using a mix of CSS and JS logic.
